          My name is Joe and I am a recent graduate from Lambda School's online immersive full stack web development program. An online 6+ month boot camp style program that focused in JavaScript and React as well as Node and Python and many tools and libraries, frameworks and methodologies. In this program I have gained experience working in a team of cross functional developers and data scientists to achieve stakeholder demands on real world projects such as Human Rights First organizations Asylum tracker application, as well a the Blue witness project.

          We used NodeJs, Python, and Express on the back end as well as learned to many tools for development such as AWS, Vercel, Github, and many many more. My focus and passion has
          always been in React and front end design, but I have a solid
          foundation in back end development as well.

          The second half of the program introduced the concepts of Computer Science. This part was the fundamentals of back end and and building databases, relational Databases and their management tools, as well as algorithms and data structures. We used Python3 for the projects we completed in this section.

            Through mock interviewing and technical interview prep courses and lectures, as well as a first class careers team, we gained a good understanding of how to present in a technical interview.
